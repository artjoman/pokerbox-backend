# PokerBox - mixed reality card game platform

## Problem
People cannot gather for events due to limited travel capabilities and meeting capabilities.

## Solution
PokerBox will allow to mix live poker matches with virtual ones, where people from around the globe will be able to join using their mobile devices or computers. Web-Server that is easy to join by just entering Room pin-code. Dealer that is dealing cards will utilize NFC/RFID technology to scan every dealt card and share the state of the game with all payers both live and online. 
Additional features:
- Chip management - bid and count your chips from your device
- Statistics - see game statistics and get different achievements
- Save the state of the game and return to it at any point of time and from anywhere
- Augmented reality support - create your avatar, and place it on the same table as other players

## Justification
There is no such platform offering mixed reality card game events. All of the platforms are offering either live-only or online-only games to play.
